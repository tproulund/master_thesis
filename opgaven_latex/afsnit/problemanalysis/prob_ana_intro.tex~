\chapter{Problem Analysis}\label{sec_problem_analysis}
When setting up a robot today, the most important factor is having a structured environment. The meaning of this is, that the robot needs to be placed at a precise location and it takes time to configure it to do one type of operation. furthermore, if it is working with conveyor belt, for example, it is necessary to forward relevant information about speed and position to the robot control unit. Organisations like SPARC keeps researching into how to improve robots' capabilities in the industry, and they have released an article, with the purpose of describing in what direction research into robotics should go \citep[p. 190]{mar_sra}. The aim of this article, that are relevant for this report, is adaptability. This means that research needs to focus on making it easier to adept a robots for new work scenarios, environment and conditions. \newline
For this report, Aalborg University has made a robot with a conveyor belt available and have a demo assembly. The University's desire is to design a visual system for the robot, which enables it to assemble the demo assembly without any information about the conveyor belt's velocity or position. Likewise the solution needs to be effective, which means the robot needs to pick up the parts for the assembly while the conveyor belt is moving. The purpose of this chapter is to present the assembly, test setup and analysing which modifications are necessary before the robot is able to assemble the assembly. This leads to the solution strategy for the remainder of the report.
