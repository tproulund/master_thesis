\section{Test setup}
The purpose of this section is to present the demo assembly and its'  individual parts. Furthermore this section introduces the test setup consisting of a Adept robot and a conveyor belt, and will analyse the physical work space and which modifications are necessary.  
%The purpose of this section is to present and describe the test setup consisting of a Adept robot and a conveyor belt. Likewise this section will introduce the object which the robot will perform the pick and place operation with. The object is an assembly and the description will consist of a presentation of the individual parts geometry and material. 

\subsection{The Assembly}
The demo assembly is made for production line tests and is shown on figure \ref{fig_assembly} and the assembly order is shown as a exploded view on figure \ref{fig_exploded}.

\noindent As seem from the figures, the assembly consist of a bottom part, the PCB, two fuses which are inserted in a spring socket and a lid. This is also the order, the robot needs to pick the parts from the conveyor belt, since all parts are spread out on the conveyor. This means the algorithm controlling the movement of the robot needs to keep track of which component it needs to pick next to complete an assembly. Alternatively, it is possible it might be more desirable for each part to come on the conveyor in batches, one batch at the time. In this the algorithm would need first to remove all bottom parts, line them up and wait for the PCB batch to arrive and put a PCB in each bottom part, for example. \clearpage



\subsection{The Adept Robot} 
The robot used for this test setup is a Adept Cobra s600 robot, shown on figure \ref{fig_cobra_workspace} and consist of three revolute joints and one prismatic. These joints are indicated on the figure with red lines.

\end{figure}\newline
\noindent The work space the robot's end effector is able to reach is determined from the joints, and this available work space is indicated on figure \ref{fig_cobra_workspace} by the blue envelope. The joints' ranges are specified in the datasheet for the Cobra s600, and are summarised in table \ref{tab_joints} along with the inner and outer radius of the work space.\clearpage


 \subsection{Work space} \label{sub_work_space}
With the work space of the Cobra defined, it is now necessary to define the available work space in the test setup. The Cobra is placed inside a cage next to a conveyor belt, shown on figure \ref{fig_pic_setup}. By making a CAD model of the work space, it is possible to better understand possibilities and limitations of it and a plan view of this CAD model is shown on figure \ref{fig_sketch_plan}, where only important features are included.

\noindent The desired pick-and-place operation is from the conveyor belt to somewhere within the drop off zone, which is a pallet inside the cage. The control of the conveyor belt is done by a frequency transformer, and is not connected to robot control unit. It is therefore necessary for the robot to match the speed of the conveyor belt, when performing the picking operation. For this test setup to be used for visual control of the Cobra and to assemble the assembly, it is necessary to modify it with a camera for visual feedback and setup the communication between the robot control unit and the visual system. Furthermore, since the assembly case and conveyor belt are black, it is assumed it is necessary to install lighting to ensure proper visual feedback.
