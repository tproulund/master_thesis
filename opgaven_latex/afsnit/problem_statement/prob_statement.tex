\chapter{Problem Statement}
With all the necessary steps to modify the test setup and necessary challenges to solve, it is possible to specify a problem statement which the remainder of this report works towards solving:
\begin{center}
  \textit{Is it possible with the modules defined in section \ref{sub_lean_startup} to use the Lean startup method to solve the goal of using visual control of the Cobra s600 to place a lid in the correct color on the housing part, without knowledge about the conveyor belt's velocity?}
\end{center}
\section{Project limitations}
This section outlines some of the limitations of this report.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \todo[inline]{Dette skal formuleres lidt bedre senere i projektperioden}Change of conveyor belt velocity at the same time of the place operation. If the velocity of the conveyor belt changes just as the robot is about to place the lid on the housing, the vision system might not be able to detect it due to the bandwidth. In this case the lid might miss the housing. 
\end{itemize}
