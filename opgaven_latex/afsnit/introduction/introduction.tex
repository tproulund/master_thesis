When setting up a robot today, the most important factor is having a structured environment. The meaning of this is, that the robot needs to be placed at a precise location and it takes time to configure it to do one type of operation. furthermore, if it is working with conveyor belt, for example, it is necessary to forward relevant information about speed and position to the robot control unit. Organisations like SPARC keeps researching into how to improve robots' capabilities in the industry, and they have released an article, with the purpose of describing in what direction research into robotics should go \citep[p. 190]{mar_sra}. The aim of this article, that are relevant for this report, is adaptability. This means that research needs to focus on making it easier to adept a robots for new work scenarios, environment and conditions.
