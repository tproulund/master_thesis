%This project covers the design and control of a load system. The load system's purpose is to test linear actuators against linear and non-linear loads. This requires a system with a test actuator and an active actuator to emulate different loads. First an initial design was made on these terms. The initial design became final by designing against static and fatigue loads, specified by the costumer, using Eurocode 3, Norton for bolt assemblies and Schaeffler's own method for the bearings. \newline
%Finally a mechanical- and hydraulic model were made and implemented in Simulink to simulate the load system by making a kinematic and kinetic analysis of the mechanical system and a dynamic analysis of the hydraulic system. The validation of the dynamic model concluded, that it is necessary to design controllers for the dynamic model to meet the design criteria. The dynamic model was transformed into a linear model, which was used to design two PID-controllers by analysing the bode plots for the transfer functions. These controllers where implemented in the dynamic model together with a saturation on the controller output signal making it necessary to implement an anti wind up loop.\newline
%The designed load system has necessary strength and service life to fulfil the design criteria and the designed controllers for the dynamic model of the load system makes the load system fulfil the dynamic requirements to the load system. In conclusion the project has been a success because all the design criterion have been fulfilled.
